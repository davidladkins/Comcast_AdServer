If deploying to a remote Tomcat server using maven script please follow instructions found at:
https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-deploy-maven-based-war-file-to-tomcat/

If you have access to the tomcat server and have permisions to shut it down and restart you can
follow the following procedure:

1. Stop Tomcat. $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/bin/shutdown.sh
2. Delete existing deployment if you have previously deployed your war file in TOMCAT_HOME/webapps
   then it has been unpacked into webapps/foo/... You must delete this directory and all its contents. 
   On Unix, this can be done with rm -r $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/foo
3. Copy WAR file to TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/.
4. Start Tomcat. $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh
